# nvidia-overclock 2.0
This is an updated version of the original [nvidia-overclock](https://web.archive.org/web/20180221193221/https://1vwjbxf1wko0yhnr.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/overclocking-tools-for-nvidia-gpus-suck-i-made-my-own/) with support for up to RTX 20x0 series Nvidia GPUs (30x0 GPUs untested, can't find one in stock!) and all known bugs fixed. The original tool with no updates or bugfixes is available in the "original" branch.

The usage syntax is `overclock.exe GPU GPU_CLOCK VRAM_CLOCK` i.e. `overclock.exe 0 135 250` for a 135MHz GPU overclock and 250MHz VRAM overclock on your first GPU.
